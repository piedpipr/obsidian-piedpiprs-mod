# Osidian Piedpipr's Mod
This is collection of my custom functionalities that I wish Obsidian had by default hence the plugin. Since using Templater or other script seems cumbersome to me, so I had to automate things a bit. This can help in buildingg excellent Obsidian + Zotero + Pandoc research workflow for reading, annotating, note taking writing and daily zettelkasten overall !

## Writing Papers: Ease of searchable information management, visualization and linking (follows and works with my personal workflow)
